Always call out the fingers!;;;AI or not (definitely is), who would ever buy this absolute monstrosity?;;;I mean those mail kiosks always use stolen art. I don\'t think it being AI suddenly changes the morality;;;I bet Disney would like to have a word with them.;;;Of course not.  Why would anyone think that of a picture that mixes intellectual properties, or has a smaller Stitch next to the larger one?  Or some weird plane-helicopter hybrid that still doesn\'t look like it should in any way be capable of flight?;;;It\'s annoying (ymmv), but the kiosk owner probably doesn\'t know or care. It\'s probably not worth hassling them in such a way that they feel the need to deny it.;;;Is this a mall in or around Charlotte, NC by chance? Wondering how coincidental a Charlotte skyscraper showing up was, I thought this was r/Charlotte at first.;;;It\'s all over Etsy too. I was going to get my mom a pretty piece for her birthday but as I was looking at the details I realized it was ai generated, mostly because of the fucked up hands. Decided not to get it. Three months later she bought the exact piece for herself so at least I know my intuition was correct. Don\'t have the heart to tell her because she really loves it.;;;I learned recently a lot of this kiosks sell stolen art.  The mall over here has one where they sell lenticular art that changes to 3 different pieces depending on the angles.  I read online the real artist has all his art stolen by these mall kiosks and he sees it all the time.  Pretty shitty.;;;Sweet droneheliplane;;;This is rich.

When I brought it up the register, the cashier said that they just get them and they don’t actually know where they come from;;;It\'s copyright infringement regardless of what tools were used.;;;You really think the people who sell bootleg merchandise give a shit about selling AI? All this means is it\'s easier to make t-shirts of Disney princesses with tattoos.;;;Mall kiosks just stole art for their stuff anyway,  so this isn\'t much different;;;I\'m sure they have no idea who created the art.

Probably everything from bands, to sports teams, to disney princesses, to car logos and super heros :D;;;Even the mall kiosks?\n\nIS NOTHING SACRED?;;;Fingers say another thing;;;I saw mall and kiosk and read mosque and was very confused.;;;Yuck;;;I\'m in a Facebook group for a mobile game (Merge Dragons) and there\'s a person who posts ""happy dragons"" as just like a fun thing they like to do.  But... they\'re all VERY CLEARLY AI-generated, but the person insists they\'re hand-drawn.  I\'m like... bruh... who do you think you\'re fooling?;;;That’s AI generated. AI art has a certain ascetic to it that human artists don’t. It’s hard to pinpoint it exactly but the lighting and general shape of the characters are the easiest way to tell.;;;Low Budget steam games are also starting to have AI thumbnails in the steam store.

Stirch is wrinkled and furless.  In addition, he has mutated and has five fingers.  This AI destroys everything same as netflix.;;;Why do you say it’s AI generated?;;;Love how stich has human skin texture rather than fur I\'m sure thats just artistic interpretation;;;The only assumption about AI that is safe is it will be mostly economic (and profit) factors that drive the way it plays out.;;;Just let Disney know.;;;I would light that on fire;;;There is a hot sheet motel in Houston called Tweetys.  They use the bird for a logo. I\'m sure Warner Brothers is proud.;;;Those fucked up claws tho;;;Im sorry but how can you tell its AI generated? What gives it away?;;;Ok then wtf is that flying behind stitch?;;;Thats rad;;;If that *was* drawn by a real artist, I\'d suggest they see a doctor. Imagine a real artist putting enough time into a drawing to get that level of detail, but then consciously deciding to just go with scribbles for an airplane or floating and misplaced claws.

People been making animated art for a long time. Or is this provable because they was already generated online?\n\nI know people use programs to make animated art that doesn\'t use AI for 20 and more years.\n\nI thought they made things in layers in image editing or creating apps?\n\nThey at least printed it on a huge printer.\n\nI don\'t see why in this time a person can\'t actually already make something like this themselves.\n\nSo im guessing this was already generated online or was too similar to what\'s already generated.\n\nAs in they didn\'t change what was generated enough.\n\nAnd don\'t make actual art manually that is similar to AI art or they already think you didn\'t make it yourself.;;;The planocoptor is killing me.;;;Ha Stitch\'s hand is all fucked up and is that supposed to be an airplane/satellite combo flying over them?  ;;;They even included Thunderbird 5 in the background;;;""Wow, the artist got a license from Disney AND Sanrio for this piece of art?

Like the AI is gonna sue them, stfu...;;;Gross.;;;I kinda love the deformed stitch though he’s so silly;;;Hello Kitty\'s clothing is the same material as Stitch\'s skin. I\'m not okay.;;;Ever since Stable Diffusion v1 (what, 15yrs ago? Wow I\'m old) that\'s all they\'ve been selling that I\'ve ever seen. You can almost tell what AI and generation it is from the art, 15yrs ago it was basically all just impressionist/modern art stuff, now it\'s got added faces and objects to that same process and even some that do whole AI generated places and people and things in bold cartoons like the Stich shot, but I\'ve never seen one that did portraits or landscapes decently (photorealism yes, an actual painting/portrait/landscape, no.) . You can always see the Stable Diffusion base code is still in here cuz they always look like that is all I can say, the AI still always wants to add what I call ""pointless video game effects"" stuff that isn\'t there like the blue soccer player image or make it ""creepy"" like the hair turning into butterflies just to the left of it. It wants to ""elaborate"" everything but uses really complex, obvious calculated/algorithmic elaborations that humans don\'t, makes every image look the same, and it seems to be addicted to the ""creepy"" shit teenagers adore. At least half the images I\'ve seen had some sort of this in it but it almost never makes any sense. You can tell that the person who coded the alpha version of this stuff had a... Let\'s call it a very particular, very consuming, **very** socially unacceptable fetish, shall we? And hard-coded his kink into what I would call the ""bios/subconcious"" level of the AI, so now that particular theme/style/kink can NEVER be removed from following generations as EVERYTHING that AI does is based on THAT fetish code as a reference.;;;Have you been to Deviant Art lately? It feels like 50% of it is AI art people are selling prints of. Or ""adoptables"" where they have giant galleries of original characters for people to purchase and use, all AI generated. \n\nThese galleries also say when an adopt is sold. A TON of them are selling, for $5-10. They are clearly labeled AI. The shop is called AI. And people are buying them up like crazy anyway. \n\nI don\'t think people give a shit at all. There is a tiny outcry on Twitter and other sites (not so much on reddit tbh in comparison) but the vast majority of people couldn\'t give a fraction of a fuck.;;;What kind of loser walks up to a mall kiosk owner and starts questioning them about their art being AI generated though? You\'re the real weirdo here OP.;;;![gif](giphy|fHgKZHDH1BHzi);;;Why were you trying to call them out lol;;;And who cares?;;;Who cares? I don\'t get this hate with people selling AI art stuff. You are in control of your wallet if you don\'t want to buy something don\'t buy it and move on with your life.  Crappy art has always existed, when AI is used as a tool properly when creating images with it you will probably never even realize it was done by AI.;;;This may be unpopular but I do think that AI art is very much still art and has value.  (The AI art duping someone’s human art is some bullshit)\n\nWe started with our hands and fingers, then maybe a charred stick, then we figured out brushes, then pencils, pens, markers etc.\n\nAI generated art is like using a super paint brush.  Good art still requires some creative component and “eye” for what looks good.;;;This garbage is officially everywhere;;;On the bright side, if it’s AI generated, that means that it’s also not licensed merch, and for a company like Disney they go hard on cracking down against unlicensed merchandise that goes against their copyright. He could incur a ton of fines for selling that stuff.;;;let the market decide;;;why does it matter, if someone likes it they like it.;;;The fingers and helicopter makes it pretty obvious it\'s AI, but as many people have pointed out already there\'s nothing no one can do about it\n\nAlthough, artistically, I\'m not sure they can sell this as art because they didn\'t have anything to do with the process of creation of the piece. They didn\'t leave it in the sun, or under the rain, and they sure didn\'t even let a monkey scribble it. That\'s simply not art.;;;Good luck paying the rent selling art.;;;Thankfully, at least for now, AI art all have the same aesthetic. So it\'s easy to spot even without noticing the various anomalies in the art itself.;;;what\'s with the shading always look exactly the same on AI art? I can tell if something is AI based solely on the way the shadows and lighting look.;;;Stuff is also infringing Disney copyrights and Messi publicity rights, which is actually unlawful, unlike selling AI creations.\xa0;;;what does it matter? it looks cool, sell it or buy it.\nyou didn\'t create it, it\'s not your property, why even bring it up?;;;So?;;;So what if it’s AI? Who cares?\n\nIf this was licensed IP you’d be paying 3x for it.\n\nIf you like the art - again - why does it matter?;;;So?;;;Ngl, it looks VERY good. I dont think that was done ONLY by AI;;;People are predictable eh;;;Whats to stop me from generating images using AI, printing them and selling them? Does Microsoft, or whatever, have copyright of that image the moment it was created. Could I get sued?;;;Where is the evidence it’s ai? /genq;;;Why is he textured like a basketball;;;Good artists steal. Great artists download.;;;What\'s the need for them to admit it\'s AI generated?;;;Bruh. I like AI, and I use it quite a bit, but it should *always* be labeled;;;is there something illegal about selling AI art? I don\'t really get why this is even mildly interesting.\n\n""Man sells thing"";;;Honestly, better than selling stolen artwork.;;;Just leave them alone op jesus christ don\'t try and do reddit threads in real life.\n\nThe worker is being screwed harder than anyone else in this scenario.;;;To be fair if it wasn\'t AI it would be shitty photoshop or just stolen art anyway, so maybe AI is the lesser evil in this situation?;;;Is there a law against selling AI art, in the mall or otherwise?\n\nWhat is everyone getting triggered about lmao.;;;I don\'t believe you. Nothing is being sold at malls anymore.;;;Hopefully people don’t buy it because it doesn’t even look good;;;I would deny it being art ...;;;How can you tell it’s AI and not digital art created by a person? Couldn’t a human do anything that AI can do?;;;Would cop tho;;;Who cares, as long as it looks cool;;;So?  Don\'t buy it;;;AI art is here to stay. There is no way to compete in a free market with a computer than can spit out “acceptable” art. There isn’t a company on this earth that will pay an artists salary when they can use AI to do that job for free.;;;Why do you care?;;;It’s still art..? No one is claiming to have painted it or anything??? lol   it’s just a picture who cares who generated it\xa0;;;LOL, does it matter if that trash is AI or made by hand? It is trash no matter who or what made it.;;;So. Don’t. Buy. It.;;;It\'s a LLC shell game like bottom of the barrel used car dealers.  Costs a few hundred for a new name, and keep on moving.;;;Probably a quick and easy way to launder cash.;;;Around 2006 and 2007 for one month in December this kiosk popped up in a mall I worked at, selling super Nintendo bootleg systems. In 2006. I think it was called Suoer zwintendo or something. And it clearly was just a famiclone. Very bizarre. It was this older east Indian guy and they were all very dusty and looked like stock from the mid 90s.;;;""Get up on the hydra\'s back!""\n\n\n(I\'m sorry I had to);;;Yeah but... If you kill the host by abandoning the malls (like is happening)  then the kiosk hydras die too.;;;Even Disney?

Idk why people do;;;Way back in the day, mall kiosks would set up and sell these 300-games-in-one devices that looked like an N64 controller but played pirated NES games. It seems to me that Nintendo lawyers ultimately glommed on to the idea of going after the entities that own the shopping malls themselves (Real Estate Investment Trusts here), because *mall management* shut them all down going into Christmas this one year I was working there (at the mall, not the kiosk).;;;I bet Disney would care. Disney has no mercy.;;;I\'m pretty sure Disney\'s legal would be more than happy to go after them.;;;I had a job at a mall kiosk for a couple weeks in 2015. Selling Christmas ornaments way too early and for way too much money. It got shut down mid November because apparently the guy running it when he wandered off, was actually harassing people to try and come to the kiosk and security got a ton of complaints.;;;Honestly- who buys anything at a mall kiosk these days?\n\nI think the last time purchase I made from one was a new phone case...for my OG Motorola razr.;;;There is such a thing as piercing the vail;;;I mean, what are you even gonna sue them for?\n\nAs it stands right now, there is no precedent for selling AI art being illegal.;;;or like the clintons. \n\nPlease don\'t upvote, i don\'t want suicide.;;;Or the plane with both the wheels on the same wing tip, assuming that\'s a wing.;;;His skin is fingerprints;;;Hello Kitty & Stitch is my favourite Disney movie.;;;And his famous foreskin nose!;;;And his single eyebrow!;;;Jesus Stitch walks on water;;;Is that...... chest hair?;;;Stitch has been drinking a little too much of the power plant water;;;Hands are hard!;;;Where’s the floating claw?;;;Can someone ELI5 to me why AI is still entirely incapable of depicting hands in any sort of way?;;;It\'s a dew claw!;;;And a penis on his chest;;;Yeah. These guys aren\'t even ethical enough to generate their own AI art. They\'re just ripping off whole images they find on the Internet.;;;...which would be ironic, if not for the characters probably being unlicensed, because if they were making bootlegs of AI art, they\'d be legally in the clear but for that.;;;""hey, I didn\'t ai generate it, I stole it!"";;;Bold of you to assume the person working the kiosk for under the table minimum wage actually runs the thing or gives a shit what the kiosk sells.;;;Or just bought images or prints off a website for cheap and had no idea about their origin.;;;""art is subjective!!""\n\n""Ai art isn\'t art!!"";;;Or it\'s just some random, cash grabby digital art.

Why would they care if it\'s AI generated.;;;Yeah don’t get me wrong AI and its implications for our future are dogshit but this is just a slightly new iteration of a very old hustle. There’s a store near my house where the owner clearly just buys clothes from Shein on Amazon then sells them for ridiculous markup;;;>they probly don’t care at all.\n\nAnd lets be honest, outstanding terminally online internet users who want to morally grandstand at every moment, most people don\'t care either.\n\nThe vast majority of people are going to mind their own business and move along, not faux outrage over ""copyright infringement"" of all things.;;;I doubt they have a license to sell Hello Kitty nor Stich merch. They probably got the print from another company and don\'t really care.;;;Homeboy got his hand slammed in a car door.;;;Unstitched.;;;Jesus, who is spending $1000 on anything at a mall kiosk?!  When I was a kid they were like cheap sunglasses, scarves, velcro wallets, keychains, just cheap garbage that was actually cheap.  And inkjet refills.;;;Dead sea lotion stuff? Those guys are ruthless. I worked in a mall for a year at a cellphone kiosk. To get to my kiosk, I had to walk past theirs and they were always smiling and nice and nothing came from it.\xa0\n\n\nFew months later, I went randomly shopping at the city\'s other mall on the opposite side of the mall. Those dead sea lotion people circled me like a vulture when I made eye contact and smiled. In just a few moments, I had lotion rubbed on and off me and a calculator shoved in my face showing ridiculous prices.\xa0\n\n\nI then realized how the ones at my mall were the exact same to customers.;;;Who buys this junk? Why are the employees so aggressive?;;;We had one kiosk at our mall where a lady was selling her hand crochet stuffed animals. I got a really really nice totoro dude for like 25 dollars. She undervalued her own work I think.;;;I had a pair of $10 mall kiosk sunglasses for like 12 that I loved and wore the fuck out of. I dropped and broke them last year  ;;;Habibi!;;;""Excuse me. Can I ask you a question?"";;;Bruh what about the plane tho!;;;It can usually do fingers now. This dude\'s using AI ancient technology from like, weeks ago, like some kind of old head who can\'t keep up.;;;Probably parents whose kids will badger them for it and don\'t know any better.;;;Seeing the success of AI art, one should never underestimate the amount of people with poor taste.;;;John Oliver for sure;;;Aside from the errors it\'s not bad for children or teens or such.;;;You would be amazed at the amount of people who live in this world who have very little sense and definitely no taste. It\'s a quality I\'ve learned spans across all economic and education levels. The ""OOOO SHINY"" demographic that has never had an authentic cultural/tasteful experience in their lives buy gimmick money wasting shit like this all the time. The cheaper ones get tacky mall kiosk posters the rich ones cover every surface in marble. Even smart people aren\'t safe. I\'ve met plenty of brainiac tech workers who have absolutely zero psychological development of anything that isn\'t the thing they are experts at. They as such have homes that are mostly empty except for the occasional ""OOO SHINY"" object pinned to a wall like in the OP.\n\nPoint is, a lot of people actually never think about taste and are pretty much consumerist zombies or cogs in a very specific machine. As such they\'ll buy stuff that looks ""pretty"" to the primordial lizard brain regardless of its actually real, authentic, worth anything, considered, of actual cultural value, etc.\n\nAlso, children.;;;the person who wants the little bag of white powder on the back....;;;Isn\'t Sanrio pretty hard on protecting their IP as well? Double whammy.;;;I was exploring South America on Google Earth and saw that many stores just have Disney characters blatantly on their products.;;;>Of course not. Why would anyone think that of a picture that mixes intellectual properties\n\nThis part is actually totally normal. None of those stores have ever licensed an IP in their life.;;;Because they\'re not selling to Disney IP lawyers or Reddit nerds. They\'re trying to catch the clueless grandparent who vaguely recognizes their 12 year old\'s third favorite movie from 6 years ago.;;;I was like ""I know that terrible unfinished looking building"".  Thank you.;;;Opry mills in nashville, new kiosk;;;It gets worse if you want to google around a bit. Half the ""custom"" stuff on etsy is drop shipped from alibaba.;;;Giant Mutated Dragonfly*;;;I want it to fail so miserably commercially that society is able to wisen up yo when it’s used;;;My local mall has a few small shops that rent a kiosk a few times every year.

It’s weird seeing Reddit jumping to protect Disney copyright.;;;You’re a real hero simping for Disney to get their royalties!;;;A good way to describe the look is “the lighting is too uniform”.\n\nNote how every object SHOULD be casting a shadow or having some minor reflective light off everything near it, but it doesn’t because each individual item is rendered and just pasted onto the image.;;;This only works with the lesser models, things are moving so quickly that the current gen is just too good.;;;> i swear you can just tell something is ai art because\n\nThat\'s largely confirmation/survival bias though. You recognize some pictures as AI generated, due to certain tells, and therefore think that AI art is easy to recognize - but you don\'t actually know how many AI pictures you accurately recognized as AI generated.  \n\nThe image generative AIs out there right now are more than capable of generating images that is virtually impossible to tell apart from other art. \n\nMost of the AI generated images you see and recognize as AI generated is the stuff someone spent roughly 10 seconds writing into a prompt before they pressed ""generate"". The moment someone spends a few minutes of effort, a lot of the typical ""AI tells"" goes away, and it becomes very hard to tell if an AI or a person drew a picture.;;;Yep it’s sometimes called the uncanny valley but all AI shit be it voices or images or text have this empty hollow feeling around the periphery that just makes you feel Ill at ease. That’s the fundamental problem with AI is that it’s developed by people who think great art is just a math problem to be solved and can’t possibly program for the unquantifiable human spirit that makes art good;;;Right now, it\'s easily noticeable in the hands. Look at the hand of stitch, it has weird fingers and the claws aren\'t in the right place.\n\nWith AI, look for continuity issues. Was there a gradual fade that suddenly became harsh, did the scene change suddenly, are the pipes/patterns consistent or logical.;;;Zoom in on Stiches hand, that is some cthulu level snafu right there. AI can\'t do hands right.;;;Look at the helicopter, it\'s nonsensical. The windows in the buildings are all wonkus. \n\nAnd for that matter, a disney character with a sanrio character?;;;You dont see Disney charecters with non Disney IP. for starters. also the background is all screwy. try looking at the ""people"";;;Without zooming in on imperfect details, a big tell is that AI is often overeager to draw wrinkles, make things shiny, or use harsh rim lighting.\n\nThe lighting actually makes sense here, but that\'s usually what I notice first.;;;You might be interested in this post on the Midjourney subreddit\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/midjourney/comments/1bgdk0c/whats_an_obvious_giveaway_this_is_ai/;;;The edges will be fuzzy and soft looking. I\'ve hardly ever seen sharp, defined lines on AI generated images.;;;Here are some more things to look for beyond the obvious mutated hands:\n\nLook at the the buildings above the cat. See how they look like they are smudged? Not out of focus but actually like they\'ve been smeared around.\n\nZoom on the cat and look at the bow. You see that weird wrinkly pattern? That\'s caused by too high cfg setting causing the starting random noise to bleed through into the output. Another dead give away. Notice this pattern is all over Stitch as well. Now look at the trees to the left of Stitch. See how the leaves kinda fit into the same pattern? It\'s much more subtle, but noticeable when you know what to look for. This is how it shows up in better gens than this one, usually in the background.\n\nNow below those trees, look at the people. See how some some of them have a kind of halo, like a double outline around them? Like it was run through an edge detect filter? That\'s caused by doing too many iterations combined with too high cfg. Probably a result of two-step upscaling to get to print resolution.\n\nFinally look at the white building above Stitch. There is an attempt at windows but they aren\'t evenly spaced or even in straight rows. That strange looking pattern also occurs if you generate something that should have multiple lines of text.;;;There are quizzes on the internet. Or if you just look at a huge number of differently created artworks, and know beforehand which one are ""AI""-generated and which one are human-generated, you gain the experience to tell the difference even in cases when some tries to trick you.\n\nIf you want to train telling ""AI"" from others: www.deviantart.com is a great place to start.;;;expecting airbrushed dolphins & rainbows;;;Bro look at Stitch\'s goddamn fingers. The plane in the background. The weird little deformed Stitch in the boat. I hope you aren\'t serious when you say it\'s hard to pinpoint.;;;Bad AI \'art\' does for sure, but this is a \'no such thing as a good toupee\' situation.

What a scam;;;Sure, here\'s a light-hearted take on AI art and humor:\n\n\nWhy did the AI refuse to play hide and seek with the art it created? Because even when it closed its eyes, the art was so... ""distinctive"" that it couldn\'t help but find it!\n\n\nAnd why don\'t AI jokes make it to comedy night? Because they always think the punchline is a math problem!\n\n\nRemember, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and humor is all about timing – even for us AIs!  ;;;> it sucks theyre profiting off it\n\nWhy?;;;Because old models tended to melt things together, the newer ones don\'t do that as much, and the upcoming ones have practically eliminated it.;;;No human input. Denoisers are just a clever probability algorithm that steals existing visuals based on weights, but has no idea what it\'s actually ""drawing"".\n\nWhen a human artist adds anything to their piece, they\'re doing it with purpose and to tell a story. Machine Learning just sees ""most artists draw this here"" and does the same. \n\nAnd since AI art is an amalgamation of billions of stolen pieces, it effectively tries to combine them all for the most generic, empty result possible, with characters staring into an empty void and no personal artstyle (unless they use a model for a specific artist, copying it 1:1).;;;uh... so like brother, thats not true at all. That last part was true for many older models. But the new ones use submodels for poses, facial expressions, objects, lights, refractions, etc. Look into LORAS. And DAllE-3. \n\nFor example:\n>but I\'ve never seen one that did portraits or landscapes decently (photorealism yes, an actual painting/portrait/landscape, no.)\n\nHere:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/DDLxXlY.png;;;If using AI is being an artist, then ordering at McDonalds is being a chef.;;;I work as a database engineer for a big company and our dumbshit useless CIO keeps holding these all hands meetings where he repeatedly insists that AI is like the discovery of fire and we should all be learning how to use it to do our jobs better. \n\nSo far all AI has proven itself to be for me is stackoverflow.com with a few extra steps. And that’s all it is! Someone plagiarized years of stackoverflow answers and shoved them into a program that’s really good at solving math problems very quickly;;;It\'s like the pettiest crime possible, and it\'s simply not worth suing you over the 5-6 pictures you\'d actually manage to sell.\n\n> Does Microsoft, or whatever, have copyright of that image\n\nAI art cannot be copyrighted, so legally nobody owns it.;;;Nothing really. Yeah sure on paper this is a massive copyright violation but in reality Disney would go bankrupt if they really tried to put their back into shutting down every bootleg store that sold unlicensed Disney shit;;;Look at stich\'s hand. The claw is floating above the fingertip\n\nLook at the windows of the background buildings, they dont line up right at all;;;The plane is all fucked up\n\nThe little stich in the bottom left has its ears in the wrong place;;;AI in general probably not. At least not yet. Disney, though, might have a word here... And Sanrio.;;;All of that is better than AI. Even the shittiest stolen art.. unfortunately..;;;The reason I disagree with this is that when you consider the processing power required to generate AI images you can basically conclude that three chimpanzees were stuffed into a meat grinder to produce this piece of shit poster;;;I miss malls.

AI has no intent. Just like that isn’t exactly a floating \xa0“claw”.\xa0\n\nThe “wing” and “claw” are just color patterns modeled to imitate a data pool. It isn’t consciously putting a wing there. Enough existing pictures had a plane there that colors resembling a plane averaged out into existing there.\n\nApprove or disapprove of it, AI art doesn’t make concepts. That isn’t Stitch or Hello Kitty in any artistic sense. Nothing was thinking about Stitch or Hello Kitty and putting it on canvas.

Just saying. I probably can be fooled, especially if an image doesn\'t contain humans or animals.\n\nBut in some cases I can evel tell completely artificial images being ""AI""-generated. Like, there was one on Deviantart that showed some moist meadow full of groups of flowery plants, with a small creek going through the meadow... and another body of water on a different level, like a long puddle with a calm connection to said creek.\n\nThis is typical. The ""AI"" combine and mix artwork while having no clue about the objects they depict.;;;I don\'t thing the makers if any ""AI"" make them to solve a specific problem, the problem *they* solve is to make some ""AI"". It\'s the people who then try to squeeze as much as possible out of them and don\'t care about the results.\n\nCheaply made images for quick money with as little effort as possible.  In *most* cases. And that\'s actually the difference between human-generated art and ""AI-generated art: The human artist wants to show off what *they* is capable of. The person who gives prompts to an ""AI"" just wants to make quick money.\n\nThere are exceptions!! Just recently there was someone on reddit who had some ""AI"" create images of fictional beings that had some connection to American areas or cities. Still ""AI""-""art"" but, well, looking good and perfectly suitable for the purpose.;;;Thanks! I\'m nervous about believing something that might be fake. Like the moon landing.

What is it? George Washington, right? But this is actually from [The Library of Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel_(website\\)). This site algorithmically assigns a hash to all possible images and in theory you can find any possible configuration of pixels within it by randomly searching. As such, this image of Washington was not created by anyone with intent, but was generated by a random configuration of pixels. It only happens by chance to be identical to an image someone made. So, is it not a picture of Washington after all? Even though it\'s an exact replica of an image of Washington created by a human with intent?\n\nHow about if I were to draw that image of George Washington, but I intended to draw Jesse Pinkman from Breaking Bad. I tell you it\'s Jesse Pinkman.

But there\'s a difference: Humans and animals deal with the objects they learn about at least somewhat directly while ""AI""s only have prompts and images. Remember (or ever encountered) the famous ""Ceci ne pas un pipe""? The image of a pipe is not a pipe - and the ""AI"" get never told that and have no idea that the difference even exists. \n\nThere would be a way way to teach a neuronal network about objects that they than should depict: By giving them a body and additional senses, basically make them into artificial anthropoids - and teach them ethics. But (sadly this is a citation of V. Putin): Nobody wants that.\n\nSo all you ever get is fakes. They\'ll get better but as long as they get taught the way they are, they\'ll never *know* what they are doing.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSource: I have written my diploma thesis in the area of optical pattern recognition, more than 30 years ago, the intention was to support self driving cars. Yes, more than 30 years ago! At that time the first experiments with neuronal networks (what is now mis-named as ""AI"") were done. They can be useful, they *have* their place, but they are mostly misused these days.;;;""Neural-net diffusion probabilistic model"" is somewhat of a mouthful.;;;>It does when you realise good art is actually a method of communication, not consumerism.\n\nThat\'s certainly an opinion.  Another opinion is that good art is something which evokes thoughts or emotions in an observer, and that\'s how we get the idea of a dead author in literature.\n\nIt applies equally in the visual arts - the intent behind a piece doesn\'t matter any more than the meaning which you derive from it.  Said intent can be said to be inseparable from the work in the sense that the work is a product of its context, and part of that context is the intent of the creator, but your interpretation of the work is ultimately unbounded by the context of the work\'s creation.  Whether the artist is dead or the artist never existed, the work now exists.  If that work gives you inspiration, if viewing that art gives rise to ideas and feelings which are novel to you, if you find meaning in that piece, then that\'s good art.\n\nTo boil it down to a binary, good art can be one of two things: That which implies meaning or that from which meaning can be inferred.  The former requires intent and thus a creator, but the latter only relies on the observer.  I think the latter is most appropriate for a definition of good art, and it doesn\'t preclude AI art - although I\'d argue that most AI art isn\'t good art in either sense.;;;Saying AI art is not art is different from saying the AI cannot create an image of something, which is what the first guy said. You\'re having an entirely different conversation.\n\nThe OP is an image of Stich from Lilo and Stitch.

(And the moment they so much as printed that out, they\'d be reproducing the characters, so that\'s where their actions come into it.) That doesn\'t relate to the work having been AI output, though. It\'s an exception because the protected character being referenced was already an authored-and-copyrighted work in its own right. That\'s not what I was talking about, and it\'s why I said ""if not for"".;;;Sorry, should I have not copied your consciousness and used that to create the AI?

In fact, it\'s the etymological root for the term ""derivative work"", which describes items that *aren\'t* copyright infringements, because society understands that absolutely everything humans ever produce is building off of ideas they\'ve seen previously. The whole ""AI art is theft"" rhetoric is just a straight-up lie perpetuated by people with financial interests against the technology, which is particularly bizarre in cases like this when it\'s extremely easy to just go for the much more accurate ""lmao this looks like shit"" instead.\n\nA more interesting argument is on whether or not the *AI* art is protected by copyright. The answer is probably ""no"" (there\'s precedent that [copyright can only be held by humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_selfie_copyright_dispute), something that\'s [explicitly part of the US Copyright Office\'s policy](https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/chap300/ch300-copyrightable-authorship.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A31%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C106%2C577%2C0%5D)), but there\'ll be lots of debate over that in the future as megacorps try to have their cake and eat it too. But as it stands now, a mall kiosk like this using AI-generated images actually means they\'re committing *fewer* crimes than the typical norm where they just take things made by actual human artists straight off of Google Images.;;;Don’t even get me started on the abomination of that mini Stitch on the left either Lol;;;My tips would be to look at the following:\n\nHands\n\nEyes(pupils usually)\n\nTeeth\n\nObject\'s alignment after passing behind something \n\nReflections\n\nPhysics, example: I had Jesus skydiving with a joyous grin and happy tears rolling down his face while falling.

Exactly as much as that artificially generated Image that ""resembles"" a painting of George Washington. YOU recognize it as the painting of George Washington because you knew that painting or a photo thereof. \n\n> Does a tree not actually exist because no one intended for it to be a tree? \n\nThat\'s an interesting question. When is a tree a tree and not a flower or a bush or an animal? You know that there are insects that resemble a twig and at times ""do their best"" ""to behave like a twig"". Now *are* they twigs, maybe for certain intends and purposes (not all, obviously)? Of course not. Do they *want* to *be* a twig? Of course not. Do they want to *come across* as a twig? Ahhh :-) But, no. Still not. They have no idea about being a twig or even looking like a twig, all they ""know"" is that their chances of survival are better when they look and behave like that little part of nature that is part of their natural environment.\n\nBack to Stitch. The ""AI"" was given a prompt that contained ""Stitch"". It has no idea what Stitch is, at best it could describe that object with attributes that would also fit to Stitch. But that\'s all. Humans think in a different way. They observe and build up an imagination, then they transfer that into a drawing (provided the human in question can draw well enough) - the imagination is shaped and restricted by observed attributes. ""AI"" don\'t care about that, they don\'t *know* that an image is not the same as the depicted object. All they have is millions of examples for a prompt and they know how to use that.\n\nEdit, I forgot:\n\n> Saying AI art is not art is different from saying the AI cannot create an image of something\n\nThis has some importance. **I hereby say that AI cannot create an image of something**, *anything* actually, simply because no ""AI"" has an idea about the *objects* it depicts. This is a bit different from the Library of Babel (provided that I understood the concept correctly from your description): If you create a hash from a certain image, there\'s a good chance that a very similar image leads to a very similar hash. But if you only have the hash, how would you arrive at the image? Trial & error would very likely lead to a very similar hash - but a completely different image, simply because a lot of images compile to the same(!) hash, if you allow a bit of fuzziness, your chances to arrive at the image the hash was created from are like the chances of a monkey to replicate Shakespeare\'s works by randomly hacking on a keyboard.;;;Ah.

But even these aren\'t great because they mostly just sell only what\'s in store at locked to store prices, so the selection isn\'t great, and in the case where it\'s more open like Walmart online that too is flooded with drop shipped crap. And the shipping tends to be much worse in speed and value than dedicated e-commerce sites. It\'s obvious they\'d prefer you end up in stores.;;;yeah but that means it can, and its improving very fast.;;;>people with financial interests against the technology,\n\nThat\'s a funny way to describe *""artists whose work is being exploited, being fed into a machine that spits out weighted averages of it purely so people who want their art don\'t have to pay them, and all for the sake of trying to make quick cash off of it.""*\n\nThe people scamming with AI shit are no better than the people scamming with literal exact copies of other people\'s art. They\'re just trying to create a degree of separation in order to get away with it better, but it\'s still very obviously the same grift.;;;Did you calculate for the fact it was Jesus, and his tears can do as they please?;;;YES!!! (I was nearly shouting at the screen :D) All of that. \n\nYou can get super far by just using your brain and applying what *you* know. \n\nIt\'s the weakness of the ""AI""s. They know millions of examples but they know zero about the objects the depict. And zero about physics.;;;Denoisers are simply a usecase of stochastic probability functions.\n\nAre you genuinely implying that\'s how your brain works?;;;He’s the son of the king’s mistress that is expelled from the kingdom by the other princes because the prophecy says he’s going to take over and bring a reign of peace and prosperity.;;;Dairy Bastard\'s my fave chain;;;There was a  ""Daisy"" Queen where I grew up.;;;I once had my own run down ice cream place one called Dairy Pauper. It couldn\'t compare to the popular place down the road though, Dairy Prince. But one day, the owner of Dairy Prince and I realized that we looked exactly the same, so we decided to switch places to see how the other one lived.\n\nAnyway, I had him committed when he tried to switch back. After that, I bought his (my) old place, then turned them both into Dairy Queen franchises and cashed out. I don\'t feel bad, I mean, who *chooses* poverty? What a doofus.;;;But he\'s still going to milk it for all it\'s worth.;;;Ah yes, younger brother to the famed Big Boy.;;;Haha I checked that too as soon as I made that post. MetaFormerlyKnownAsFacebook.com is free however.;;;Rebrand to sour adult\xa0;;;> somehow upended triple-A gaming on their own and made it into being whatever is considered ""woke"" these days\n\nAnything to deny the reality that the cultural zeitgeist has, once again, moved in the direction of equality.;;;This is the first time I have heard of this at all.\n\n\nLooking it up, it\'s like, seriously, these dumbasses need a proper hobby.\xa0 I hear Bird watching is fun.;;;Big changes that stood out to me:\n\n* Severe reduction on the number of new tweets you could actually see at a time.  Even today, it tries to tell me there\'s all of 14 tweets on the platform.\n\n* Changes to news posts so they look like pictures and not much else, until you click into them.\n\n* ~~Can\'t block anybody now, or at least not without third party tools to do so, and at which point you\'re not even really blocking them.~~ EDIT: Apparently not a thing.   Elon even just joking over it was enough to make me disengage from the platform quite a bit, NGL.;;;Half the people doing the day-to-day to keep shit running got axed, and then there are the intentional changes, like making it range from hostile to nonfunctional unless you\'re logged in.;;;You\'re something of a toxic user yourself;;;Oh wow that’s so interesting! How do you spot stuff like that? And why do they do this?;;;Do you even want an answer? If yes, a serious one or a funny one?\n\nMy default mode would be to write serious answers but here I cannot make sense of that line you wrote. It could be a joke or something I don\'t recognize.;;;That\'s terribly generic tho. All the brain scan medical stuff is also based on GAN stuff.;;;This is a lot of empty sophistry and it\'s obvious you don\'t really understand the concepts you\'re touching on. You dislike AI art, so you\'ve gone one step further than ""AI images are not art"" to the totally asinine ""AI images are not images."" \n\nI\'ll just point out two things.\n\nModern animation studios use computers extensively in their projects. Original images of characters like Buzz Lightyear as made by the studios themselves will have involved AI. There are parts of these characters and their animation that are not created by humans, but by computers interpolating parts of the characters automatically. That being the case, is there actually no thing known as ""Stitch"" according to you, because he is composed of many different constituent images, some originating from humans, and some not initially created by any human with intent? \n\n""Oh, but these characters were created primarily by animators curating the use of the tool"" is one possible argument of several against that, but this and all other arguments can be used equally with the case of AI image generators like that used in the OP. You need to start adding more rules. This inevitably creates a totally balkanized and incoherent view of what constitutes a ""real"" image. The more you try to refine and compartmentalize your definition of what a ""real"" image of something is, the clearer it becomes that you can\'t create a universal definition. You finally find that if some part of an image is not 100% curated by a human with intent, it must not be an image of anything. This is nonsense. \n\nSecondly, it is without doubt that one day an AI will make physical objects of its own design. One day an AI will draft and print an actual, physical aircraft wing, not only a representation of one. Is this object not actually a wing? If it is, then why is an image of a wing made by an AI not also an image of a wing?;;;Also an accurate one.\n\nIt\'s completely normal for people to be against anything that is perceived as a threat to their career. Has happened with every technological advance in history. Remember how much taxi drivers absolutely *hated* Uber and other ride-sharing apps? Didn\'t really do much to stop them though, even though there\'s so many actually horrible things Uber and its ilk do that they could have spent time criticising instead of making it so transparently a matter of ""we don\'t want competition"".\n\nIt\'s a road walked many times, the least you could do is check the street signs to see where it leads. Instead you keep blindly repeating ""it\'s stealing"", something that **your own explanation** of AI deriving things contradicts.\n\n> and all for the sake of trying to make quick cash off of it\n\nA technological advance that drastically reduces labour costs sounds like a fantastic opportunity to equally drastically hike corporate tax rates and use that to fund a universal basic income. After all, like you\'ve said, this technology could not exist without relying on the pre-existing work done by citizens - both in terms of the software itself and in the training. Those AIs weren\'t created by some tech giant, they were created by all of society, and all of society should share in their benefits.\n\nI\'m as against the cash-grab economics of capitalism as you are, but I\'ve seen this play out enough times to know that just trying to convince people not to use a tool that will save them money is not going to play out the way you want it to, and if you\'re going to try to legislate something in response to it, at least pick something that actually has a *chance* of being successful or enforceable.;;;>He’s the son of the king’s mistress\n\nThe Dairy Bastard?!;;;100%.  You would figure they would be able to find time to maybe enjoy video games too, but dang do they ever seem to pour a lot of hate into their pastimes.;;;>it tries to tell me there\'s all of 14 tweets on the platform.\n\nThat\'s probably because of who you follow. I see plenty of new tweets.\n\n>Changes to news posts so they look like pictures and not much else, until you click into them.\n\nYeah, this one does happen. *I* don\'t think it\'s too big of a deal, but this one\'s just personal preference.\n\n>Can\'t block anybody now\n\nYeah, you can. I use the block button all the time. It works same as always. Elon once claimed he was going to remove, but after a lot of people pointed out that app stores have a policy on needing one, it seems he\'s changed his mind.;;;Pffft;;;Karma farming. Get enough karma to make reposts certain subs; get more karma, goes on long enough the account can be ""sold"" to someone that needs a ""vetted"" account to push \'X\' agenda, advertise \'X\' products without paying ad fees, etc. It\'s called astro-turfing or something of the sort.;;;>I\'m as against the cash-grab economics of capitalism as you are,\n\nIt truly doesn\'t sound like you are, considering your whole argument is just *""ok sure they\'re stealing and grifting but whatever it\'s already happening and you can\'t stop it sooooooooo...""*\n\nLike fuck off bud;;;I never thought that I\'d need a restaurant named that, but I definitely do.;;;The illegitimate ROYAL Dairy Bastard! On his 21st birthday he’ll learn of his origins & begin a plot to overthrow the king & take his rightful place on the throne!\n\nEDIT: Straight Outta Shakespeare;;;I do keep my follow list intentionally low, and I\'ve found sometimes that I\'ll miss their tweets even in my timeline directly, until I go to their profile and view them from there.  It didn\'t use to be that way though, and frankly I don\'t really have an interest in growing out who I follow all that much.\n\nDidn\'t know on the block button detail though, thanks for that.;;;The irony of seeing it happen on a thread about AI!']"
