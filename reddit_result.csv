ChatGPT,Banning AI for school use would be the equivalent to banning computers in favor of the pen and paper.,"I understand the fears of ai, and I understand I‚Äôm preaching to the choir here by posting in this community. 

But I keep seeing rampant ‚Äúdiscussions‚Äù at the college level, where schools claim to ‚Äúwant to use AI in an ethical way‚Äù and ‚Äúuse it to improve educational models‚Äù, yet at the same time, they harshly bolden the consequences of cheating using ai, and the only efforts trying being made are those to impede AI usage. My university recently found space on its payroll, and are now trying to hire for an individual who is an ‚ÄúAI and cybersecurity expert who can effectively control and manage AI and Machine learning systems‚Äù. Essentially, they want someone who can control, and to a degree,  censor the use of these services.

Who is being hired to find ‚Äúethical uses‚Äù? Who is being hired to find the ‚Äúeducational benefits‚Äù?

I, by my colleges standards, ‚Äúcheated‚Äù using ChatGPT. Instead of resorting to an overly verbose online biology textbook, sporting a glitch-filled format that has not been updated since 2016, I inserted a simple biology question into chatgpt.

 I got the correct answer, and learned the correct information in a matter of seconds. In order to perform the same word-seeking operation manually, it would have taken me 5+ minutes.

Maybe- instead of shooting down the methods of AI just because we see its prevalent usage- we should examine what it is doing for us. It‚Äôs highlight the flaws clearly of our incredibly inefficient education models. If you ever had to use McGraw Hill or any other similar program, you would understand this sentiment. It‚Äôs as if these programs were barely designed with the end user in mind.

I understand the desire to ban ChatGPT for testing purposes. But for those suggesting to ban ChatGPT for schools use all together, it will only exacerbate the current issues with learning systems, and in the end, cause the affected school to be stuck in the past.",0.81,0.81,0,120

ChatGPT,Thank you to everybody who complained about the bad GPT-4 Turbo before the new fix,"Sam Altman (OpenAI CEO) posted this on Twitter 15 hours ago:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;there is a new version of GPT-4 Turbo now live in ChatGPT; you should hopefully find it a lot better!

&gt;please let us know what you think.

&amp;nbsp;

The people a couple days ago who complained about the downgraded performance, we took a lot of sh*t for it. Many people were saying we're just stupid trolls, we should fuck off, etc.

Let me tell you a little about how the business world works. If nobody complained, then OpenAI would never know what's wrong and what needs to be improved. And then as a result we would all be stuck with a worse product while paying the same price every month (including you non complainers)

So instead of being willfully silent and ignoring problems, as if reddit was North Korea and everything was perfect, let corporations know when they're done something wrong üôÇ

Thanks folks who voiced your complains, we all just want to have access to the best GPT-4, to assist with our tasks, businesses, and problem solving

Still love OpenAI, and it was nice of them to listen

Hope this doesn't sound like some hippie gobble de gook

ChatGPT,The first wave of Custom GPTs are really pretty terrible and obviously not tested,"It's only been a week but this first round of Custom GPTs are mostly (not all) really bad. It's so easy to create a GPT with just a few lines of instructions and give it a fancy name and people have picked the low hanging fruit. I am guilty as well, creating a game or two and a few personalities.

I also see absolutely NO testing of the GPTs. Some GPTs with specific sounding names answer no better than the default ChatGPT. And some ""developers"" have created dozens upon dozens of GPTs in mere days - there is no way they could have tested them thoroughly because you quickly run against your cap. I tested one of my quick back and forth game GPTs and ran into that exact problem.

Hopefully the upcoming store will have some barrier to entry and the ability for users to review GPTs. The current lists that are cropping up all over the place accept everything and anything and are just trying to make a buck... hundreds of dollars to be featured at the top of a list that has 30untested GPTs? Come on!

ChatGPT,Forked out ‚Ç¨22 for GPT4: nothing seems to work so far,"I have been toying around with chat GPT, bing and lately mostly Bard since exactly one year, and have now bit the bullet and gone paid GPT4. So far I'm quite underwhelmed:

* My attempts at two-way spoken communication have been hampered by GPT always speaking over me, even after we agreed on a signal word to indicate I was fininished, or for it to always wait 5sec before starting. 
* I tried uploaging my location history spreadsheet as csv and xls for analysis. GPT kept saying ""there's no file attached"".
* I asked it to search and analyze all articles by a specific author in one newspaper. It only found three when a simple google search produced 20.

I hope it'll get better, or I will?

ChatGPT,Do Custom GPTs have to ‚Äúre-read‚Äù their training data for every inquiry?,"I made a personal ‚ÄúCar Expert‚Äù GPT for my specific car by uploading a bunch of PDFs like the Owner‚Äôs Manual and my vehicle maintenance records and also provided links to user forums for my car model. 

I gave it instructions to be an expert auto mechanic specializing in troubleshooting problems with my car model and to use all of the files I uploaded as reference material and what kind of questions it should check the forums I linked to for. 

Almost every time I try to use this GPT it says it‚Äôs ‚Äúreading documents‚Äù for as long as 6 minutes, then returns an ‚Äúerror try again‚Äù message.

I assume one or more of the following factors are at play:

1.) My GPT instructions or uploaded training data is causing the problem and I‚Äôll need to troubleshoot on my own 

2.) OpenAI‚Äôs performance degradation is still in play and my GPT isn‚Äôt getting the horsepower it needs on the backend. Nothing I can do but wait

3.) GPTs don‚Äôt actually ‚Äútrain‚Äù (remember, synthesize) on the uploaded data, rather they hold the data there **in case** they need to reference it and every prompt that directs it to the data causes it to ‚Äúre-ingest‚Äù the data for that specific inquiry?

I really hope #3 is not at play here. 

Do any of you have any insights into why my first test GPT performs so poorly?

Update1: it sounds like GPTs don‚Äôt ‚Äútrain and retain‚Äù, rather need to re-read uploaded training data as-needed

Update2: I found my first ‚Äúnatural language programming‚Äù bug! In my instructions, I wanted my GPT to prioritize the info in the Owner‚Äôs Manual over web content, so I told it to look there first. As it turns out, that was directing the GPT to re-read the entire Owner‚Äôs Manual for all inquiries, so yeah, that will grind the system down. 

I reworded that instruction and performance is much better! However it‚Äôs still struggling with returning info that I KNOW is in the manual, so I edited the manual PDF to remove unnecessary pages and had Adobe do a file size reduction to try and make the manual friendlier for GPT. I hope this shows some improvement for answers from the manual‚Ä¶",0.8,0.8,0,3
ChatGPT,The Caveman: My new favorite way to get straight forward answers from ChatGPT,"The unwillingness of ChatGPT to give straight forward recommendations for even the most inconsequential decisions has been one of the most frustrating part of using ChatGPT for me. Even the most mundane decisions are being treated like life altering events and you're being flooded with a mountain of bloated text that doesn't really take a stance anyways. Requesting a ""ungabunga caveman friendly reply"" was surprisingly effective in condensing it down into straight forward advice.

Fallout Adventurer

As you step out of Vault 101, the blinding light of the sun greets you, a stark contrast to the artificial lights of the Vault. Before you lies a vast expanse of desolation, remnants of a world long gone. Buildings, once tall and proud, now stand crumbling and hollow. The ground is parched, covered in patches of struggling vegetation and debris from a forgotten time.

In the distance, you can see a dilapidated city skyline, a haunting reminder of the past. The air carries a heavy silence, broken occasionally by the distant howl of a mutated creature. A gentle breeze stirs up dust and old newspapers, revealing faded headlines about the war that reshaped the world.

Your purple hair catches the sunlight as you adjust your blue Vault 101 jumpsuit, feeling its familiarity and comfort. You clutch your trusty water bottle, knowing its importance for survival in this harsh landscape.

To your right, a rusted signpost points towards what used to be a major highway, now just a broken path leading into the unknown. To your left, a small town with decrepit buildings beckons with the possibility of scavenged supplies.

It's time to make a choice for your first destination in this new world. Do you head towards the city, hoping to uncover secrets and supplies amidst its fallen skyscrapers, or explore the nearby town for immediate resources?

A few hours later:

From your elevated position on the mountainside, you spot an abandoned shack in the distance. It's an intriguing structure, potentially holding supplies or information. However, a group of ghouls roams around it, posing a significant threat.

With your new sniper rifle, you have the advantage of distance and precision. You find a stable position to set up for the shot, lying prone to steady your aim. Rex stays close, his senses alert to any additional dangers.

You take a moment to focus, understanding the importance of conserving ammunition. Each ghoul requires careful targeting, ideally with a single, well-placed shot. The scope of the rifle brings the ghouls into clear view, and you begin to take them down one by one.

The rifle's report echoes off the mountains, a stark reminder of the constant struggle for survival in this world. With each shot, a ghoul falls, until the path to the shack is clear. It's a testament to your growing skills in combat and your ability to adapt to different situations.

The area now secure, you and Rex make your way down to the shack. The anticipation of what might be inside adds to the sense of accomplishment from your strategic use of the sniper rifle.

ChatGPT,Dumping Alexa for GPT?,"Me and Alexa have been stepping it out for a good few years. She's nice and all. She can do everything I want, but as I get older I want some new things, things that Alexa can't give to me!

ChatGPT,Shouldn't there be a free development mode for the API?,"For developers, most APIs offer free usage for development purposes and then when the app is in production, the service makes money.

I mean, when developing with Stripe, there's live and test/sandbox mode. Test mode is vital to develop your app and iron out bugs. Stripe don't charge you 3.something% of your *fake* testing transactions, only the real ones so why does OpenAI charge for testing use of the API?

I'm trying my best with all sorts of prompts but it seems like dall-e or chatgpt do not seem to understand the nature of what a tile in a 2d game is - an asset that can be repeated and combined seamlessly with other tiles to create a 2d scene. I've tried various extensive prompts but I still end up getting imagery that is not at all combinable or repeatable. It's mainly just a grid laid over an image or at best small images on every tile.
