# Main Topics Per Month

## January 2023
- General opinion of Generative AI
- AI modified video/photos (issues with trust,  misinformation, non-ethical)
	- “The use of AI-modified video has the potential to have negative consequences for society, particularly when it comes to issues of trust and misinformation. For example, deepfake technology can be used to create highly convincing videos of people doing or saying things that they never actually did or said. These videos can be used to spread false information, or to manipulate individuals or groups for political or financial gain. Additionally, the use of AI-modified video raises ethical questions around consent and privacy. While it also has some potential benefits, such as in film and entertainment, it is important to be aware of the risks and to put in place regulations and other safeguards to mitigate them.”
